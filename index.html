        <h1>My Favorite Meal</h1>

        <p> The name of my favorite meal is <strong>Nigerian Jollof Rice.</strong><br></p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>ORIGIN OF THE NIGERIAN JOLLOF RICE</h2>
        <p>Jollof is believed to have originated in the Senegambia region of West Africa among the Wolof people, where
            it is
            known as <i>benachin</i>. The mouth-watering meal has travelled throughout the sub-region because of the
            frequent cultural exchange that goes on there. As such, it has evolved into several regional varieties,
            laced
            with the heritage of the place where it is prepared. Nevertheless, it maintains its magic and is relished
            all
            over Africa.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who aren’t familiar with Jollof rice and are wondering how a rice dish can pack so much
            punch, the secret is in how it soaks up so much flavour. You would not imagine that boiling plain rice in
            the
            same pot as peppers, tomatoes, spices and meats would create such soft, yet crisp tomato-stained grains,
            with so
            much sweetness locked inside them. </p>

        <h2>DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARATION</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, red poblano (or bell) peppers, chopped onions, with 2
                cups of stock, blend till smooth, about a minute or two. You should have roughly 6 cups of blended mix.
                Pour
                into a large pot/ pan and bring to the boil then turn down and let simmer, partly covered for 10 - 12
                minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat oil and add the sliced onions. Season with a pinch of salt, stir-fry for 2 to 3
                minutes, then add the bay leaves, curry powder and dried thyme and a pinch of black pepper for 3 - 4
                minutes
                on medium heat. Then add the tomato paste - stir for another 2 minutes. Add the reduced
                tomato-pepper-Scotch
                bonnet mixture, stir, and set on medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes till reduced by half, with the lid
                partly
                on. This is the stew that will define the pot.</li>
            <li>Add 4 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce and bring it to boil for 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice and butter, stir, cover with a double piece of foil/baking or parchment paper and
                put a
                lid on the pan—this will seal in the steam and lock in the flavor. Turn down the heat and cook on the
                lowest
                possible heat for 30 minutes, stirring half way through.</li>
            <li>Stir rice—taste and adjust as required. If rice isn't soft enough/ needs additional cooking, add 1/4 to
                1/2
                cup of stock or water, stir through and continue to steam, on low till cooked through.</li>
            <li>If you like, add sliced onions, fresh tomatoes and the 2nd teaspoon of butter and stir through. Let
                rest,
                covered for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>To make Party Rice, you'll need one more step. Now Party Rice is essentially Smoky Jollof Rice,
                traditionally cooked over an open fire. However, you can achieve the same results on the stove top.
                Here's
                how: Once the rice is cooked, turn up the heat with the lid on and leave to "burn" for 3 to 5 minutes.
                You'll hear the rice crackle and snap and it will smell toasted. Turn off the heat and leave with the
                lid on
                to "rest" till ready to serve. The longer the lid stays on, the smokier. Let the party begin!</li>
